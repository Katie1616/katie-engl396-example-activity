## Rankings of Fruit 
| Fruit | Ranking |
|------:| --------| 
| Bananas | DETEST! Tell me why every smoothie has to taste like Bananana??? |
| Apple | Convienet, really depends on the type. Makes my hands sticky but not *not* worth it |
| Orange | I have been known to enjoy a good orange. Not a fan of all the stringy bits, but satisfying to pick off | 
| **Raspberries** | LOVE! The best, very expensive though. Could eat a whole container in one sitting |

Despite the banana hatred I love minions! Please find my favorite image below!
