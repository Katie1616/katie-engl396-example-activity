## Rankings of Fruit 

| Fruit | Thoughts |
|:---------|------------|
| Bananas   | DETEST! Tell me why every smoothie has to taste like Bananana???   |
|  Apple    | Convenient, really depends on the type. Makes my hands sticky but not *not* worth it   |
|  Orange   | I have been known to enjoy a good orange. Not a fan of all the stringy bits, but satisfying to pick off      |
| **Raspberries** | LOVE! The best, very expensive though. Could eat a whole container in one sitting |

Despite the banana hatred I love minions! Please find my favorite image below!
